# Stellar Atmospheres: assignments
Assignments for the Stellar Atmospheres and Stellar Winds course ([B-KUL-G0I51A)](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/G0I51AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idm6709584)) at KU Leuven.

Exercise 1: Slab model will be done during the exercise session, while Exercises 2 and 3 form a take-home assignment described in Modeling_AGB_winds.pdf
The take-home assignment requires the modeling code [Magritte](https://magritte.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which we will install during the slab model exercise session.
